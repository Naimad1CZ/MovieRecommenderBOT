# movie-recommender-bot
 A bot that recommends some random movie after user specifies some parameters.

The `server.py` is run as the backend for the Messenger bot which you can message yourself here: https://www.facebook.com/movierecommenderbot

To run the dialogue system locally from command line, run `python run_dialmonkey.py`. 
Note: required libraries are in `requirements.txt` (install them e.g. by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`), the Python version used by me is `3.10.4`, but it should run on other Python versions too.

The best initial user input is `Hi` or `Hello`.
